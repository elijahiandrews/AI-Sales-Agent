# AI-Sales-Agent
A system that can autonomously find, qualify, and book meetings with high-value leads. The architecture is complete and modular, meaning we can launch a functional MVP within weeks. Once live, this agent can replace a small team of SDRs, scale revenue without adding headcount, and continuously optimize itself using AI learning loops.
